<h2>지존길드 ㅋ 지존그룹 ㅋㄷㅋㄷDelay to launch of SpaceX's Ship</h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank" title="지존우주국">Elon Musk's company</a></strong> was scheduled to launch its first-ever crewed mission, a test flight to the International Space Station (ISS) called <u>Demo-2</u>, this afternoon (May 27) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. <strong>But <U>bad weather</U> has nixed that plan</strong>, pushing the liftoff back to Saturday (May 30) at the earliest, <br>NASA and SpaceX officials announced today.</br>
<p>The Starship SN4 prototype exploded at about 1:49 p.m. CDT (2:49 p.m. EDT/1849 GMT) at SpaceX's test facility near Boca Chica, Texas according to a video provided by the South Padre Island tourism site SPadre.com. The explosion occurred about a minute after a short test of its Raptor rocket engine, but it was unclear what caused the conflagration.</p>
